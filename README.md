# [C# Player's Guide] The Long Game
**[C# Player's Guide Book](https://csharpplayersguide.com/)**

My Solution for the C# Player's Guide Challenge for "The Long Game".

**Objectives:**
<ul>
<li>When the program starts, ask the user to enter their name.</li>
<li>By default, the player starts with a score of 0.</li>
<li>Add 1 point to their score for every keypress they make.</li>
<li>Display the player’s updated score after each keypress.</li>
<li>When the player presses the Enter key, end the game. Hint: the following code reads a keypress and
checks whether it was the Enter key: Console.ReadKey().Key == ConsoleKey.Enter</li>
<li>When the player presses Enter, save their score in a file. Hint: Consider saving this to a file named
[username].txt. For this challenge, you can assume the user doesn’t enter a name that would produce
an illegal file name (such as *).</li>
<li>When a user enters a name at the start, if they already have a previously saved score, start with that
score instead.</li>
</ul>
